        <h2>A NEW ENGINE</h2>
        <p>"Enclosure 3-D" is a modern remaster of the game using a three-dimensional voxel engine (RVX).  Press F2 during gameplay to switch between original and remastered graphics.</p>
        <h4>System Requirements (mid-2010s machine or newer):</h4>
        <ul>

        </ul>

        <h2>THE STORY (in short)</h2>
        <p>You play Mike Goodman, a small-time con man who, after yet another night of bad business, gets an offer he just can't refuse.</p>


        <h2>COMMANDING MIKE</h2>
        <p>Use number pad/arrow keys on your keyboard moves the main character north, south, east, west or diagonally.  To halt your character's steps with the keypad, press the last direction key again or the number 5.  If you don't have a numpad, you can still use Home/End/PageUp/PageDown keys to move Mike diagonally.</p>
        <p>Talk to your computer in commands of one or two words, or even simple sentences.  Unless otherwise instructed, follow all commands with the ENTER key.</p>
        <p>You may meet others who have a message for you.  Command them to speak.  Type:</p>
        <p>TALK TO THE MAN</p>
        <p>You may later need objects you see along the way.  Type:</p>
        <p>GET THE KEY</p>
        <p>Pay attention to details.  To see an object closely, type:</p>
        <p>LOOK AT THE DESK</p>
        <p>Use the objects you find along the way.  Type:</p>
        <p>GIVE THE BASKET TO THE GIRL</p>
        <h2>SPEED CONTROL</h2>
        <p>To fully savour a scene you enjoy watching or negotiate a narrow path, you can slow down the animation.  Speed up the animation to make the main character walk faster.  You can change the speed by using the "minus"- or "plus"-button.  </p>

        <h2>SAVING AND RESTORING YOUR GAME</h2>
        <p>
        To allow for errors in judgment, and also for some pretty creative exploration, we make it possible for you to save and restore the game.  Before you try something that looks dangerous, or just because you've been playing awhile and you don't want to lose what progress you've made through some chance encounter, save your game.</p>

<h3>SAVING A GAME</h3>
<p>Type "save game" and press ENTER, or press F5 to save your current game location.  You may not be able to save during dialogs or critical events in the game.</p>
<p>If you are standing before a tree when you save a game, call your saved game "STANDING BEFORE A TREE" or whatever has meaning to you.  You are permitted to save up to 15 different game locations at once.</p>
<p>If you "run out" of saved game positions (you want to save more than 15 games) you will need to manually move save files to another location or reuse (save over) one of the 15 positions you've already saved.  To change the name of a previously saved game, just enter Control-C and type a new name.</p>
        
<h3>SAVE GAME LOCATION</h3>
        <p>Your save game location depends on your platform:</p>
        <ul>
  <li>Windows: <pre style="display: inline;">C:\Users\&lt;your username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Enclosure 3-D\</pre></li>
  <li>Linux: <pre style="display: inline;">/home/&lt;your username&gt;/.local/share/Enclosure 3-D/</pre></li>
  <li>macOS: <pre style="display: inline;">/Users/&lt;your username&gt;/Library/Application Support/Enclosure 3-D/</pre></li>
      </ul>
<p>You can also change the save game location in enclosure3d.ini file.</p>

<h3>RESTORING A GAME</h3>
<p>Type "restore game" and press ENTER.  You can also press F7.  Then select the game you wish to restore by moving the pointer and pressing ENTER.</p>


      <h2>TIPS AND ADVICE</h2>
      <p>
          If you haven't played one of Sierra's 3D animated adventure games before, here are a few suggestions to help you get on the right track...
      </p>

      <p>
          <strong>LOOK</strong> everywhere. When you go somewhere you haven't been before, or where you think you may have missed something the first time, the first thing you should do is look around.  When you type "look" on entering an area, you will receive a description of the general area.  Read this description carefully -- often there is a clue to the game or an indication that something in the scene bears further investigation
      </p>

      <p>
          Thoroughly explore your surroundings.  Open doors and drawers, look under things and behind things for valuable objects and clues.  Look closely at all objects you encounter or you may miss important details.  If you are standing close enough to a particular object you can take a close look at the specific thing.  EXAMPLE: "look at spaceship."  Press ENTER each time you type a command to enter that command.
      </p>

      <p>
          <strong>EXPLORE</strong> each area of the game very carefully, and DRAW A MAP as you progress through the game.  Make a note of each area you visit, and include information about objects found there and dangerous areas nearby.  If you miss an area, you may miss an important clue!
      </p>

      <p>
          <strong>TALK</strong> to almost everyone you meet, but use discretion!  Some characters will be friendly and helpful.  They will give you valuable information and advice.  Others may mislead, capture, or even kill you.  At times it maybe be necessary to fight at others, to run away, hide or try to outwit your opponent.
      </p>

      <p>
          <strong>GET</strong> anything that isn't nailed down.  You'll come across a number of objects that will be of use later in the game.  Some of these can be picked up, other may have to be bought or traded for.  You can see an inventory of items on hand by pressing the TAB key at any time.
      </p>

      <p>
          <strong>USE</strong> the items you have picked up to solve problems in the game, or to help you to make progress and discover more clues.  Different approaches to a puzzle may bring about a different outcome.  Some problems have obvious solutions; if you're thirsty, take a drink of water.  To purchase an item, you'll need some money.  Other problems require more imagination to solve.
      </p>

      <p>
          <strong>BE CAREFUL</strong>, and remain alert at all times - disaster may strike in the most unlikely of places!
      </p>

      <p>
          <strong>SAVE YOUR GAME OFTEN</strong>, especially when you are about to try something new or potentially dangerous.  This way, if the worst should happen, you won't have to start all over again from the beginning.  Save games at different points, so you will always be able to return to a desired point in the game.  In effect, this will enable you to travel backwards through time and do things differently if you wish.  NOTE: You cannot save your game during certain critical times, so remember: SAVE EARLY, AND SAVE OFTEN!
      </p>

      <p>
          <strong>DON'T GET DISCOURAGED</strong>.  If you come to an obstacle that seems insurmountable, don't despair.  Spend some time exploring another area, and come back later.  Every problem in the game has at least one solution, and some have more than one.  Sometimes solving a problem one way will make it harder to solve the next, and sometimes it will make it easier. If you get stuck, you might try backtracking to an earlier point in the game, then choosing a different path.
      </p>

      <p>
          If all else fails, you can write to other players for hints.  Try an AGI Messageboard or a Discord Channel and ask for help in the game you're playing.  Please be polite and give enough information for other people to follow.  WARNING: Don't resort to using a walkthrough, this will ruin the enjoyment and puzzles of the game.
      </p>

      <p>
          <strong>BRING ALONG SOME HELP</strong>.  You may find it helpful (and fun) to play the game with a friend.  Two (or more) heads are better than one at interpreting clues and solving problems, and heroes throughout history have worked in teams.
      </p>

      <h2>TROUBLESHOOTING</h2>

      <p>If the game crashes look for error.log file which might contain the reason.</p>

      <p>If you're having stuttering issues try switching VSync off in the menu.</p>

      <p>If you're using OBS and seeing stutter, make sure to use OBS's Game Capture mode (and not Window Capture).</p>
