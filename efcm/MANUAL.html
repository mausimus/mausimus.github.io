                    Medieval Japan. An evil daimyo lord has stolen the treasures of Imperial family and hidden them in his castle in an attempt to seize power.

                    bring prominence to your clan. However, a member of a competing clan has also discovered daimyo's scheme and is on the same
                    mission as you. Do whatever it takes to be the first to recover stolen items and bring honour to your clan.

                <h3>Tricks</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>To help your chances you can use Shinobi <b>TRICKS</b> from your Inventory to protect Items you've found as well as hinder your opponent's progress. See Tricks section below for details.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Countermeasures</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>To counter your opponent's Tricks, you can pick up helpful <b>COUNTERMEASURES</b> from around the Castle. See Tricks section below for details.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Confrontation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inevitably you will run into your opponent as you perform your mission, in which case a <b>MARTIAL FIGHT</b> is inevitable. See Battle section below for details.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Exit</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once you have all <b>FIVE ITEMS</b>, look for a <b>SECRET EXIT</b> somewhere in the Castle. It will look like a broken wall panel.</li>
                    <li>Depending on game configuration, Exit might be visible from the <b>START</b> or only from the moment a player acquires all Five Items.</li>
                    <li>Once you are in front of the <b>EXIT</b> holding all Five Items, <b>OPEN</b> it like a regular Door and pass through.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Time</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The burning <b>INCENSE</b> represents <b>TIME</b> you have left to escape. Falling victim to Tricks or losing fights will make the incense burn faster.</li>
                </ul>

                    It is up to you to find the winning strategy! But here are some tips:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Until you have the <b>BAG</b>, <b>STASH</b> any Items you find in places you remember and <b>PROTECT</b> with Tricks.</li>
                    <li>Keep an eye on your opponent's actions and remember your opponent is watching.</li>
                    <li>Only rely on fights if you have no other option as they are difficult to win consistently.</li>
                    <li>If your opponent has a big advantage, focus on Tricking them rather than on remaining Items.</li>
                    <li>If you can find the Exit or the last Item first... make sure to "prepare" them for your opponent.</li>
                </ul>
