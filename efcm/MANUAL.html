                    Medieval Japan. An evil daimyo lord has stolen treasures of the Imperial family and hidden them in his castle in an attempt to seize power.
                    As a young Shinobi apprentice you've decided to sneak into the castle, recover the treasures and return them to their rightful owners in an
                    attempt to bring prominence to your clan. However, a member of a competing clan has also discovered daimyo's scheme and is on the same
                    mission as you. Do whatever it takes to be the first to recover stolen items and bring honor to your clan.

                    <li>Once you have all five items, look for a secret exit somewhere in the castle. It will look like a half-open door.</li>
                    <li>Depending on game configuration, Exit might be visible from the start or only from the moment a player acquires all five items.</li>
                    <li>Once you are in front of the Exit holding all five Items, Open it like a regular Door and pass trough.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Time</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The burning incense represents the time you have left to escape. Falling victim to tricks or losing fights will make the incense burn faster.</li>
